If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
No, Java will not allow this. Method overloading (which constructors use) requires methods to have different signatures, meaning a different number of parameters or different types of parameters. Two constructors with a single String parameter, regardless of the parameter name (title vs. category), have the exact same signature: (String).
